Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirement


Q1)

Functional Requirements:


New User Registration: Any new user must be able to register itself into the system before using it.

User Login: The user must be able to login or sign in into the system once they are registered or have created their account.

Issue/Reissue book: The member or the user should be able to issue the book by login into the system through their user registration. The user should also have the access to extend its date of return or reissue the book that has been issued or borrowed earlier from the same user account.

 Search book: The user should be able to search all the required books by just logging into the system and searching or filtering out on the required basis.

Request Book: The user should be able to request the book for the future if it is not available currently and this request should be made visible to the administration.

Reminder or due date: The user should be able to see the due date of returning the book/s especially when multiple books have been issued as this will allow the user to not miss the due date for returning.

Librarian access: This will allow them to supervise the user activities and note and take action if the rules have not been followed. They must also be able to inform the user if the requested book is not available and respond to some special requests of the users for any specific book or material.

Non member access: All the non member users should be able to search or browse the books in the system online but should not be able to issue or borrow them.

User verification: The user should be able to verify itself using the email authentication so that the system is able to differentiate between the registered users and non registered users.

Security: The password of all the users used for login should not be stored as plain text. 



Non-Functional Requirements:


Performance : The system should be able to handle more users at a specific time let say 40 users logging in at a specific time and should be accessible 24*7 and not at some specific time.

Security : The System must be accessible to only those who are present within the LAN of the institute. This will ensure security.

Accessibility : The UI/UX should be simple enough so that everyone can access it without any complications, if possible we can make it .

Usability : It should be available in more than one language
 
Reliability : The system should have quick response time and should recover fast in case of a crash.

Usability : Adding new features should be easy and it should be portable.




Q2)

Scope:

A decent percentage of the population suffer from hearing disability or any specific kind of hearing impairment. This application adheres to the needs of its special users. The AI here would help the user to identify different sound around them and even display them on a screen. It will also alert the user in case a sound has been detected which has been classified as unsafe or dangerous. With the help of all the predetermined sounds, it will alert the user and help them being in contact with the surroundings. This wil act as a source of noise which will help them recognize all the sounds around them through the display and alert. Thus, this product or application would keep all its users alert and safe. This will solve the sole motive of the application and thus has good scope.   


Features:


It should be able to gather all the information it receives from surroundings in the form of noise and predict the source and nature of that particular noise.

The information of the noise should be displayed on the screen so that the user is aware of every piece of information.

An alert is mandatory in the form of a vibration and blinking light or SOS.

The application should be available on all platforms and should also be available on the device of the caretaker or guardian of the person who has to be contacted or reported to in case of an emergency.

The alert should be made to switch off manually. This will ensure that the user is now aware of the situation. Moreover if the user fails to switch off the alert manually and AI predicts it to be a dangerous noise or a danger, then the incident must be reported to the concerned individual after some specific time.



Non-Functional Requirements:


Performance : The AI should be able to detect new sounds and report it to the server about the lack of information on a particular sound.

Reliability : The AI should be able to differentiate between loud noise and dangerous noise and should not classify both of them as unsafe.

Accessibility : The price of the application should be minimal to make it more available to the user.

Maintainability : The database of all the predetermined noises/sound should be changed or updated regularly.
